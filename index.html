      <h1>CSCE 242 Class Page- Zak Elguindi</h1>
      <p>CSCE 242 is a web-dev class aimed at helping students learn different web applications. Primary languages will be html and javascript. This will be a page that I use to host all of my assignments on.</p>

<!-- Change the default font of the page to something more appealing
Change the color scheme, recoloring all the text, and making sure it matches nicely.  Don't just pick one color.
Add a background color or image (Which makes sense), then
Add a formatted div, which allows the page content to be easily viewed.
Remove the underline on the links to each assignment
Recolor the links of each assignment so they are not the default blue.
Make sure to use Id's
Make sure all your colors match, and your theme looks nice. -->
