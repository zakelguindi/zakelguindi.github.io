<!-- Change the default font of the page to something more appealing
Change the color scheme, recoloring all the text, and making sure it matches nicely.  Don't just pick one color.
Add a background color or image (Which makes sense), then
Add a formatted div, which allows the page content to be easily viewed.
Remove the underline on the links to each assignment
Recolor the links of each assignment so they are not the default blue.
Make sure to use Id's
Make sure all your colors match, and your theme looks nice. -->
