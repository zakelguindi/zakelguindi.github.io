Polymorphism- a single function call / action that can take different forms based on the situation 

virtual function - function that uses dynamic / late binding. is bound to run time based on the type of object the pointer points to at the time 
redefined function - use static binding - function call 

virtual functions need to be set as virtual in the base class 
they must be implemented or made as "pure virtual". 

if a class has a pure virtual function, it is an "abstract class" and we can't instantiate object of that class 

when your class has virtual functions- make the destructor virtual so that when 
memory is freed for a base class pointer to a derived class object, all the correct 
destructors will be called
