Creating Server Code
  Create your node server with express
  You will create an array of items, when the user goes to a link like: .../api/data, they will see a json list.
  This will be created using javaScript and express.
Creating the Data
  On a topic of your choice
  Contains at least 5 records, which each:
    Contains at least 6 properties
    1 of which is an array of data
    1 of which is a link to a picture you are hosting
  Make it seem coherent
  To clarify, this is like a class with 6 properties, and 5 instances of the class.
Client Side Code
  Create the index.html page, along with the script.js and styles.css
  On this page, all the information in the JSON files fetched from the server will be beautifully displayed, using
    CSS and flexbox
  Make sure to show the images for each record
  Make sure the arrays are displayed in a desirable fashion
  The format you display your content in, cannot closely resemble something that we've done previously. Be creative!
  Make sure you are doing everything from scratch, and are not copying and pasting from the work we did in class.
