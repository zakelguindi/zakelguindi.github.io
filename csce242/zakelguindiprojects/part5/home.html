      <h1>Zak Elguindi</h1>
      <h3>Student</h3>
      <p>I currently attend the University of South Carolina pursuing a career in software development or other tech-related fields. </p>

          <div id="aboutme-content" class="hidden">
            <p>Coming out of high school I had no idea what I wanted to pursue, and I eventually came to the decision to go down the Computer Science route, 
              but with a general belief that I'd switch to something else if I didn't think CS was for me. Within six months I knew that this was what I wanted my career to be, 
              as I found it really interesting, and I was pretty good at it. 
            </p>
            <p>I committed to the Computer Information Systems major at USC, as I found it to be like an "Applied Computer Science" degree. I think that while I do want to pursue software dev
              as of 2023, I understand it might not be what I want in 2040, so a major like this can let me explore the business/IT side of it more- which is exactly what I did in my first internship. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't have the skills nor the experience to work as an intern after my freshmen year, but made it my #1 goal as a sophomore to land one (and one I was really excited for).
              I was able to land a position with AmerisourceBergen (now known as Cencora), working for their SAP team under my director, Nipin. I really enjoyed working for AB last summer, and found myself working with very accomplished 
              and well-respected people. While I wasn't given the largest responsibilities, I still found my work very interesting, and felt like I represented myself well throughout the experience.
              Thankfully, some of those within the company felt the same, and at the end of the summer I was offered to work part-time during the school year for them. 
            </p>
            <p>This time, I would move from Nipin's team of 15+ employees to a new manager, Penny, and I was her only employee. Her job is to analyze the ROI of different IT solutions, and 
              works them out with all the other teams (info security, budgeting, etc) to make sure we fill out all of the business-team specs in the most efficient way possible.
              I'm learning so much from this position and I'm really glad I was given the opportunity, as I get to learn so much about the intersection between tech and business. 
            </p>
